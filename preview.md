**Message**: Perfect. Let's start with questions about attention and focus.

These questions are from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale.
Think about how you've been feeling the past 6 months.

### ADHD (ASRS-6) (past 6 months)
1. How often do you have trouble completing the final details of a project -- once the challenging parts are done?
2. When you have to do a task that requires a lot of organization -- how often do you have a hard time getting everything in order?
3. How often do you have problems remembering appointments?
4. When you have something to do that requires a lot of thought -- how often do you delay getting started? Or avoid the task altogether.
5. How often do you fidget – or squirm with your hands or feet – when you have to sit for a long time?
6. How often do you feel overly compelled to do things, like you were driven by a motor?

**Message**: Next, a couple of questions about mood the last 2 weeks. These help us get a fuller picture of how you're doing.

### Depression (PHQ-2) (last 2 weeks)
1. How often have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things lately?
2. How often have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?

Again, this is over the last two weeks.

### Anxiety (GAD-2) (last 2 weeks)
1. How often have you felt nervous, anxious, or edgy lately? Again, think about the last two weeks.
2. Any difficulty controlling worry?
