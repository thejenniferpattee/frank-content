# frank-content

What it is:
A data-only repo for Frank content: screener item text, instrument metadata, psychoeducation taxonomy, and mapping rules.

What’s real vs planned:
Real: initial JSON placeholders and draft structure.
Planned: populate JSON with final content and add a one-click demo path.

Not included on purpose:
App code, any backend or UI implementation, and any real user data.

## Purpose

This repo stores Frank content as data so it stays editable and auditable without changing app code.
